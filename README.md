# Find Me A Linux Distro
[Find Me A Linux Distro]("fmald.net"), or FMALD for short, is a website that finds random linux distribution.

These distributions might be ones you know and use, remixes of distributions, country exclusive, and so much more. FMALD is still needs more distributions so if you have any distribution you want to be in the website, make sure to put them in the [issues](https://github.com/KripC2160/findmealinuxdistro/issues). The Linux distributions however still are focused on ones that run on computer (so no server or mobile Linux). 
Feedbacks are welcome :D
